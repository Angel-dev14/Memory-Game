# memoryGame

This is my first javascript project that I did for my final laboratory exercise at my faculty.

It's a memory game that matches two same photos.

Game logic desc:
Upon opening two the first one closes and the third one compares with the seccond one.

It was coded from scatch using online photos and resources.
