<h1>Memory Game</h1>

This is my first javascript project that I did for my final laboratory exercise at my faculty.

It's a memory game that matches two same photos.

<5>Game logic: <h5>
Upon opening two blocks they compare if they don't match the first one closes and upon opening a third one it compares with the seccond one.

It was coded from scatch using online photos and resources.
